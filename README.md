# Pesticide Risk Reduction: An International Guideline

This pesticide risk management guideline accompanies Jepson PC, Murray K, Bach, O. et al. A global guideline for pesticide
selection to reduce risks, and establish a minimum pesticides list, The Lancet, Planetary Health 2019;

## Background

We provide a system that classifies pesticides by the hazards and risks that they pose, and we identify a list of pesticides that are lower in risk. Widespread use of this classification system should accelerate phase-out of the most hazardous pesticides, mitigate some of the risks associated with pesticides that are less toxic, and encourage use of pesticides that are compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs.

The intended audiences for this guideline include farmers and other pest-management decision makers, agricultural educators and extension workers internationally, and standard-setting bodies that underpin the global market in agricultural exports. It accompanies a peer-reviewed article, where we outline the background to, and some example uses of, this system.

As an end user, you may work through the pesticide tables in this guideline, selecting pesticides that are not highly hazardous, or which do not require risk mitigation â€“ thus limiting and progressively reducing risks on your farm, or among your clients.
