      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>We provide a system that classifies pesticides by the hazards and risks that they pose, and we identify a list of pesticides that are lower in risk. Widespread use of this classification system should accelerate phase-out of the most hazardous pesticides, mitigate some of the risks associated with pesticides that are less toxic, and encourage use of pesticides that are compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs.</p> 
      <p>The intended audiences for this guideline include farmers and other pest-management decision makers, agricultural educators and extension workers internationally, and standard-setting bodies that underpin the global market in agricultural exports. It accompanies a peer-reviewed article, where we outline the background to, and some example uses of, this system.</p>  
      <p>As an end user, you may work through the pesticide tables in this guideline, selecting pesticides that are not highly hazardous, or which do not require risk mitigation – thus limiting and progressively reducing risks on your farm, or among your clients.</p></p>

          <p>Pesticides requiring risk mitigation (see text for details of mitigation methods). Only use these products if you are trained, and you have access to high quality personal protective equipment (PPE) for mixing, loading, handling, application, clean-up, and during the of restricted entry period. “Higher-level personal protection required” (✓) indicates that occupational exposure risk assessments have demonstrated potential for exposure, and significant acute or chronic risks. If labels do not provide details of PPE for applicators, a precautionary PPE recommendation is: wear coveralls over long- sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and stout shoes, with chemically resistant gloves, with protection for eyes (i.e. a face mask or goggles), and respiratory protection (i.e. a respirator). For pesticides labeled as having a requirement to mitigate bystander risk, wear respirators with an organic vapor (OV) cartridge or canister with any N, R, P, or 100-series filter. Some of these compounds require additional engineering risk mitigations such as closed mixing, and closed cabs, and are not suitable for smallholder farmer use. Please obey all restricted entry and pre-harvest intervals indicated in the label.</p>

          <p>Pesticides that do not trigger environmental or bystander risk mitigations, but which require additional occupational health risk mitigation, in addition to baseline personal protective equipment (PPE). Occupational exposure risk assessments have demonstrated potential for exposure, and significant acute or chronic risks. If labels do not provide details of PPE for applicators, a precautionary PPE recommendation is: wear long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and stout shoes, with chemically resistant gloves, with protection for eyes (i.e. a face mask or goggles), and respiratory protection (i.e. a respirator). Please obey all restricted entry and pre-harvest intervals indicated in the label.

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to using the Pesticide Tables</h2>
      Please use the steps below to develop a plan for how to introduce and make use of these tables with farmers, or other IPM decision makers.
      <article>
        <h3>Step 1: Develop your IPM Plan.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Consider what you can do to limit pest presence and damage before using pesticides, and develop a plan for adopting these practices.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 2: Develop Pesticide Lists.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Assemble a list of all pesticides that are registered and available locally for your intended use.</li>
          <li>If possible, determine which of these pesticides are efficacious, based upon locally-relevant data.</li>
          <li>Ensure effective training in pesticide storage, transport, personal protection, handling, application, cleanup and disposal.</li>
          <li>Note that one may BEGIN this process with the last table (3b), which lists only lower-risk pesticides that may meet your pest management needs.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 3: Identify and Reduce Highly Hazardous Pesticides.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Refer to Table 1 to determine if any of the pesticides that you have listed are classified as Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs), and also determine if additional compounds have been listed as HHPs because of evidence for impacts locally.</li>
          <li>If no pesticide on your list is an HHP, move on to Step 4.</li>
          <li>If you have included an HHP, select a less toxic alternative that does not fall within this classification.</li>
          <li>If no suitable alternatives are available, and IPM alternatives to pesticides have been exhausted, it is essential that steps are taken to protect handlers, applicators, bystanders, and the environment. You must first follow label instructions, but in cases where these are not available or incomplete, see some examples of risk management for HHPs below (see “RISK MITIGATION MEASURES”).</li>
          <li>Develop a plan to phase out use of any HHPs by adopting a wider array of IPM tactics, and by consulting experts including researchers, extension agents, and other farmers, about effective alternatives.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 4: Identify Pesticides Requiring Risk Mitigation.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Refer to Table 2 to determine if any of the pesticides that you have listed require risk mitigation.</li>
          <li>If no pesticide on your list requires risk mitigation, move to Step 5.</li>
          <li>If you are considering a pesticide that requires risk mitigation, consider using an alternative, lower risk pesticide that does not fall within this classification (Step 5).</li>
          <li>If no alternatives are available, and IPM alternatives to pesticides have been exhausted, it is essential that steps are taken to implement risk mitigation practices, and to protect yourself and bystanders. You must first follow label instructions, but in cases where these are not available or incomplete, we provide examples of effective risk mitigations for pesticides below (see “Risk mitigation to protect aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, pollinators and bystanders” under “RISK MITIGATION MEASURES”).</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 5: Identify and Select Lower-Risk Pesticides</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If none of the pesticides that you are considering are HHPs or pesticides requiring risk mitigation according to our analysis, refer to Tables 3a &amp; 3b.</li>
          <li>IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU CONSIDER LOCAL REGULATORY, HEALTH, AND RESEACH INFORMATION THAT MAY FACTOR IN RISKS THAT OUR ANALYSIS HAS NOT CONSIDERED, BEFORE DEVELOPING A FINAL LIST OF PESTICIDES THAT MAY FIT WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM</li>
          <li>If one or more pesticides that you are considering are not referred to in either Tables 1, 2, 3a or 3b then either, the risks associated with this pesticide have not yet been analyzed, or, the data to carry out the risk assessment are not available. In this case, follow label instructions, and unless you have clear guidance that this pesticide is of low risk, treat the pesticide as if all the mitigations in Step 2 are required, and protective clothing (PPE) is needed for handling, application and clean-up.</li>
          <li>If you are considering pesticides that are listed on Table 3a or 3b, then lower risk pesticides are available to you. Note however, that the pesticide label may address other risks that need to be managed, or it may indicate a requirement to manage risks that our analysis did not consider.</li>
        </ol>  
      </article>
      NOTE: Never assume a pesticide is safe. Our classification system is a guide towards risk reduction, but you must handle every pesticide with care, and apply it correctly at the labeled rate, and only on the crops and pests indicated on the label. Please also note that pesticide formulations vary widely in concentration, and the hazard that they pose to handlers.

      <h2>Risk Mitigation Measures</h2>
      <section id="hhp-exceptional-uses">
        <h3>
          Risk mitigation for exceptional uses of HHPs listed in Table 1
        </h3>
        <p>One goal of this document is to illuminate a pathway for removal of HHPs and their attendant hazards. In our work in voluntary sustainable certification standards it became clear that in some circumstances, a transition period was necessary for some HHPs, because alternatives were not immediately apparent or available. In these cases, exceptional risk management steps are needed. HHPs should only be used when applicators are effectively trained, when medical supervision is available, and when protective clothing is both available and used. If these basic requirements cannot be met, then Table 1 is best interpreted as a “do not use list,” because the costs to human health and the environment are likely to exceed any potential benefit from pesticide use.</p>
        <p>The risk management guidance below is intended to supplement information that may be found on the pesticide label, and can be used when risk management information is lacking or in addition to the information provided on the label.</p>
        <article>
          <h4>Reproductive toxins</h4>
          <p>At least eight HHPs with reproductive toxicity are in widespread use: borax, boric acid, carbendazim, epoxiconazole, fluazifop-butyl, glufosinate-ammonium, quizalfop-p-tefuryl, and tridemorph. Replacing the use of these pesticides with lower risk chemicals, or non-chemical practices, is an important priority for risk management.</p>
          <p>Where use is considered essential, or during phase-out, the following risk management guidelines should be implemented.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Include the use of essential HHPs as part of a rotation with less toxic pesticides.</li>
            <li>Women of reproductive age (15-50 years) should not apply pesticides that are classified as reproductive toxins.</li>
            <li>Workers applying reproductive toxins should wear the most protective clothing that is available, including chemically- resistant gloves, boots and socks, long pants and long sleeved shirt, overalls that cover trousers and shirt, respirators and face masks, and should exercise high levels of caution when handling pesticide containers and sprayers.</li>
            <li>Restricted entry intervals should be implemented for all persons entering the field after application. These should be at least 48h, or as indicated on the pesticide label, whichever is greater.</li>
            <li>Potentially affected persons or communities should be identified and alerted in advance of application, flags should be used to identify treated fields, and access to treated fields should be prevented.</li>
            <li>Non-crop vegetative barriers and/or non-application zones (see specifications below) should be maintained between treated fields and areas of human activity.</li>
          </ol>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Nematicides</h3>
          <p>Most nematicides are highly toxic, and many are HHPs. There are less toxic alternatives entering the marketplace, and there are many non-pesticide options available, particularly prior to planting. However, a risk mitigation program should be implemented while alternatives are sought. The list below, developed by the SAN under international review, provides an example risk mitigation program for five nematicides that meet the criteria for HHP designation: cadusafos, ethoprop, fenamiphos, oxamyl and terbufos:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Use lower toxicity nematicides as part of the rotation of nematicides for resistance management.</li>
            <li>Use application methods that place the product precisely within the plant root zone, or use tree injection.</li>
            <li>Workers applying reproductive toxins should wear the most protective clothing that is available, including chemically- resistant gloves, boots and socks, long pants and long sleeved shirt, overalls that cover trousers and shirt, respirators and face masks, and should exercise high levels of caution when handling pesticide containers and sprayers.</li>
            <li>Avoid uncovered application of granules, particularly close to aquatic areas.</li>
            <li>Limit daily maximum application time for applicators to eight hours, in two shifts, with bathing to wash off residues.</li>
            <li>Make applications during the coolest hours of the day.</li>
            <li>Monitor applicator health annually for kidney and liver function.</li>
          </ol>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Rodenticides</h4>
          <p>Many rodenticides are, by definition, mammalian toxins, and many are HHPs. The following risk management guidelines are important to limit risks when using brodifacoum, bromadiolone, bromethalin, chlorophacinone, difethialone, diphacinone, strychnine, warfarin and zinc phosphide:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Food sources attracting rodents and debris should be eliminated.</li>
            <li>Signs of rodent activity (droppings, tracks, gnaw marks, burrows) should be monitored and the results recorded. Traps should be inspected daily, and bait stations and installations weekly.</li>
            <li>Rodenticide-baited traps should only be used inside buildings if, and only if, rodent monitoring demonstrates that mechanical-only control methods are not effective.</li>
            <li>Use of rodenticides should be restricted mainly to the protection of storage places for harvested crops, and crop packing stations and handling facilities.</li>
            <li>Routine field applications should not be undertaken: the need for them should be determined by scouting, and applications should be localized and their effects monitored.</li>
            <li>Only formulated rodenticide-baited traps classified as moderately toxic (blue label in some countries) or slightly toxic (green label in some countries) should be used.</li>
            <li>Bait stations should be tamper- resistant, anchored, and constructed in such a manner and size as to permit entrance only by rodents.</li>
            <li>Rodent carcasses should be handled with gloves and buried in locations that do not pose risks to human or wildlife health or water contamination.</li>
            <li>Bait stations should be removed and the amount of stations diminished when there are no longer signs of rodent feeding or, if there is evidence of use by non- target wildlife.</li>
          </ol>
        </article>
        <p>Pesticides classified as HHPs because of pollinator impacts: the three neonicotinoids clothianodin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, and the phenylpyrazole fipronil were classified as HHPs because of evidence for their adverse impacts on pollinator populations. Open field uses of these pesticides should be minimized and phased out, and treatment of perennial crops should be avoided because of their persistence, and accumulation in plant tissues. If less toxic and efficacious pesticides are not available, and if any of these insecticides are used in annual crops during a phase-out period, mitigation measures that limit RISK TO POLLINATORS should be used.</p>

              <li>Other effective mechanisms are used to reduce spray drift.</li>
            </ol>

      <h2>Final Advice to End Users</h2>
      <p>If we are to reduce the persistent use of pesticides that pose high risks we will need to operationalize science-based systems such as this one, in order to support pesticide use decision-making in ways that factor in risk and hazard more prominently. By doing this, we may overcome an important barrier to IPM adoption, and provide opportunities for more sustainable management of pests, diseases and weeds that currently do not exist in pesticide-dependent systems.</p>
      <p>Pesticide handlers, applicators and farm workers are exposed directly and indirectly to pesticides, and it is essential to read labels and observe precautions including protective clothing, restricted entry, and pre-harvest intervals. However, this information may be lacking or insufficient in the context of pesticide use in developing countries. We have demonstrated that restricted entry intervals on some pesticide labels are insufficient to protect farm workers in West Africa.7</p>
      <p>IPM compatibility is also an important consideration. Our guideline does not yet summarize toxicity to natural enemies, pesticide resistance management, pesticide efficacy, or the cumulative risks associated with complete annual pesticide programs. All of these should be factored into pesticide use decisions that are made in an IPM context, and our classification system should be viewed as a contributor to broader IPM decision-making.</p>
      <p>The HHP and risk mitigation lists already underpin internationally-applied voluntary certification standards that have been created to protect farm workers and the environment in tropical countries. Farmers in more developed systems such as the USA may use these tables to monitor pesticide risks on their farms and to document risk reduction, if they adopt the selection process that we propose.</p>
      <p>Farmers and their advisors with limited access to pesticide and IPM education may use this guideline as a source of reliable and rigorously obtained data, for use when selecting and purchasing pesticides, and when managing risks.</p>
      <p>Note</p>
      <p>We have used science and evidence-based processes throughout the development of these lists. Placement of pesticides in a particular table is determined by our analytical process and by criteria of hazard established by high-level UN committees. We included a number of public and professional consultations in development of the lists and tables, and they represent current knowledge about pesticide hazards and risks. Certain pesticides attract controversy, such as the herbicide glyphosate, which has entered the public domain because of legal action. We have reviewed the evidence for carinogencity, and followed the conclusions of the WHO/FAO JMPR that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. 14 We do however track new information, and review the placement of all pesticides in our tables, and they should not be viewed as static or permanent.</p>
