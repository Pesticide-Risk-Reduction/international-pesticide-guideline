      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>We provide a system that classifies pesticides by the hazards and risks that they pose, and we identify a list of pesticides that are lower in risk. 2Widespread use of this classification system should accelerate phase-out of the most hazardous pesticides, mitigate some of the risks associated with pesticides that are less toxic, and encourage use of pesticides that are compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs.</p> 
      <p>The intended audiences for this guideline include farmers and other pest-management decision makers, agricultural educators and extension workers internationally, and standard-setting bodies that underpin the global market in agricultural exports. It accompanies a peer-reviewed article, where we outline the background to, and some example uses of, this system.1</p>  
      <p>As an end user, you may work through the pesticide tables in this guideline, selecting pesticides that are not highly hazardous, or which do not require risk mitigation – thus limiting and progressively reducing risks on your farm, or among your clients.</p></p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to using the Pesticide Tables</h2>
      Please use the steps below to develop a plan for how to introduce and make use of these tables with farmers, or other IPM decision makers.
      <article>
        <h3>Step 1: Develop your IPM Plan.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Consider what you can do to limit pest presence and damage before using pesticides, and develop a plan for adopting these practices.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 2: Develop Pesticide Lists.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Assemble a list of all pesticides that are registered and available locally for your intended use.</li>
          <li>If possible, determine which of these pesticides are efficacious, based upon locally-relevant data.</li>
          <li>Ensure effective training in pesticide storage, transport, personal protection, handling, application, cleanup and disposal.</li>
          <li>Note that one may BEGIN this process with the last table (3b), which lists only lower-risk pesticides that may meet your pest management needs. 2</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 3: Identify and Reduce Highly Hazardous Pesticides.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Refer to Table 1 to determine if any of the pesticides that you have listed are classified as Highly Hazardous Pesticides (HHPs), and also determine if additional compounds have been listed as HHPs because of evidence for impacts locally 1</li>
          <li>If no pesticide on your list is an HHP, move on to Step 4.</li>
          <li>If you have included an HHP, select a less toxic alternative that does not fall within this classification.</li>
          <li>If no suitable alternatives are available, and IPM alternatives to pesticides have been exhausted, it is essential that steps are taken to protect handlers, applicators, bystanders, and the environment. You must first follow label instructions, but in cases where these are not available or incomplete, see some examples of risk management for HHPs below (see “RISK MITIGATION MEASURES”).</li>
          <li>Develop a plan to phase out use of any HHPs by adopting a wider array of IPM tactics, and by consulting experts including researchers, extension agents, and other farmers, about effective alternatives.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 4: Identify Pesticides Requiring Risk Mitigation.</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Refer to Table 2 to determine if any of the pesticides that you have listed require risk mitigation.</li>
          <li>If no pesticide on your list requires risk mitigation, move to Step 5.</li>
          <li>If you are considering a pesticide that requires risk mitigation, consider using an alternative, lower risk pesticide that does not fall within this classification (Step 5).</li>
          <li>If no alternatives are available, and IPM alternatives to pesticides have been exhausted, it is essential that steps are taken to implement risk mitigation practices, and to protect yourself and bystanders. You must first follow label instructions, but in cases where these are not available or incomplete, we provide examples of effective risk mitigations for pesticides below (see “Risk mitigation to protect aquatic life, terrestrial wildlife, pollinators and bystanders” under “RISK MITIGATION MEASURES”).</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Step 5: Identify and Select Lower-Risk Pesticides</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If none of the pesticides that you are considering are HHPs or pesticides requiring risk mitigation according to our analysis, refer to Tables 3a &amp;b.</li>
          <li>IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU CONSIDER LOCAL REGULATORY, HEALTH, AND RESEACH INFORMATION THAT MAY FACTOR IN RISKS THAT OUR ANALYSIS HAS NOT CONSIDERED, BEFORE DEVELOPING A FINAL LIST OF PESTICIDES THAT MAY FIT WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM</li>
          <li>If one or more pesticides that you are considering are not referred to in either Tables 1, 2, 3a or b then either, the risks associated with this pesticide have not yet been analyzed, or, the data to carry out the risk assessment are not available. In this case, follow label instructions, and unless you have clear guidance that this pesticide is of low risk, treat the pesticide as if all the mitigations in Step 2 are required, and protective clothing (PPE) is needed for handling, application and clean-up.</li>
          <li>If you are considering pesticides that are listed on Table 3a or b, then lower risk pesticides are available to you. Note however that the pesticide label may address other risks that need to be managed, or it may indicate a requirement to manage risks that our analysis did not consider.</li>
        </ol>  
      </article>
      NOTE: Never assume a pesticide is safe. Our classification system is a guide towards risk reduction, but you must handle every
      pesticide with care, and apply it correctly at the labeled rate, and only on the crops and pests indicated on the label. Please also
      note that pesticide formulations vary widely in concentration, and the hazard that they pose to handlers.
